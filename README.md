### ‚ú® [Try the Live Interactive Playground!](https://baseline-vanguard-playground-nvkf.vercel.app) ‚ú®

An intelligent ESLint and Stylelint tool that helps developers adopt modern web features by automatically providing fixes and performance suggestions based on [Web Platform Baseline](https://web.dev/blog/baseline) data.

## The Problem

Modern web development moves fast. It's hard to know when a new CSS or JavaScript feature is **safe to use** in production. This leads to time-consuming checks on sites like MDN or CanIUse, or worse, avoiding powerful modern features altogether.

## The Solution: A Proactive Co-pilot

Baseline Vanguard is more than just a checker; it's a **proactive co-pilot for modernization**. It integrates directly into your workflow to:

1.  **Identify** code that isn't universally supported according to Baseline.
2.  **Automatically fix** it by applying safe fallbacks or progressive enhancement.
3.  **Suggest** performance improvements where modern native APIs can replace heavy libraries.

## What Vanguard Can Fix Right Now

This project provides a robust proof-of-concept with several high-impact rules:

#### JavaScript (via ESLint)
*   **`Array.prototype.at()`**: Automatically replaces `.at(index)` with a robust, index-safe fallback that works in all browsers.
*   **`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()`**: Modernizes your code by replacing this unsafe pattern with the safer, recommended `Object.hasOwn()`.
*   **Performance Suggestion (`moment.js`)**: A unique rule that detects the import of the heavy `moment.js` library and suggests using the native `Intl` API, helping you reduce your app's bundle size.

#### CSS (via Stylelint)
*   **`:has()` selector**: Automatically wraps any rule using the `:has()` selector in a `@supports (selector(:has(*)))` block, ensuring progressive enhancement.
*   **`@container` queries**: Automatically wraps any `@container` at-rule in a `@supports (container-type: inline-size)` block, allowing you to use modern layout techniques safely.
